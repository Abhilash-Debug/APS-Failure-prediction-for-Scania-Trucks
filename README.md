# APS-Failure-prediction-for-Scania-Trucks
Objective of this work is is to develop a model to predict risk of failure of the APS system of heavy Scania truck.


  This project provides an end to end approach to develop a model for failure prediction of Air Pressure System (APS) of heavy Scania trucks using dataset provided in IDA, 2016 challenge. The proposed approach helps the predictive model outperform previous approaches by significant margin.
